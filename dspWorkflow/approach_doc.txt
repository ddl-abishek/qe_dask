Approach Document/Making sense of data:

1. The goal is to ultimately give a bird's eye view of the dataset through some unsupervised learning approaches. Each fiscal year .csv will be analyzed separately.

2. There are 51 columns in 2013-14 .csv. All columns may not be necessary to consider for analysis. Discard unnecessary columns. Omitting some columns will be necessary as dataset size is too big i.e. ~2GB per fiscal year. Hence, each column's importance will be assigned as accordingly discarded. 

3. Following are the unnecessary columns:-
 - Summons Number
 - Plate ID
